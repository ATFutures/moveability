# moveability: Forget walkability, i wanna skate

## Warning: Currently experimental only

Infrastructure to calculate comprehensive moveability statistics for a nominated
city. Moveability is intended to connote any means by which people might
actively move thenselves, primarily implying walking and cycling, but also
potentially skating, scootering, wheelchairing, or any other conceivable form of
active transport.

Currently concept-only demo only calculates walkability (and doesn't even do
that properly just yet, but it will soon enough ...)

## Usage

Currently only one function that works like this:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library (moveability)
verts <- moveability (city = "muenster germany")
```
The function does a heap of heavy work, downloading the entire street net and
calculating routes between every single pair of points in the network. This
is likely to take quite some time - at least several minutes - but will provide
progress information on the way. The result is a `data.frame` of all points in
the street network for the nominated city, with a column `$m` quantifying
walkability. The result can be directly viewed with
[`mapdeck`](https://github.com/SymbolixAU/mapdeck) with the following code:

```{r mapdeck, eval = FALSE}
library (mapdeck)
set_token (Sys.getenv ("MAPBOX_TOKEN"))
loc <- c (mean (verts$x), mean (verts$y))
verts$m <- 20 * verts$m / max (verts$m)
mapdeck (style = 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/dark-v9',
         zoom = 12,
         location = loc) %>%
    add_pointcloud (data = verts,
              layer_id = "walkability",
              lon = "x",
              lat = "y",
              radius = 10,
              fill_colour = "m")
```
